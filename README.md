# SpoilSense: AI-Powered Produce Spoilage Detection Using YOLOv8

SpoilSense is a lightweight, real-time computer vision system built to detect spoilage in fresh produce using a custom-trained YOLOv8 object detection model. The project uses a dataset of 10,000+ annotated images across various fruit categories to distinguish between fresh and spoiled items — potentially enabling smart monitoring in agricultural, retail, and food supply chain environments.

---

## Purpose

The primary objectives of SpoilSense are:

1. To develop a deep learning model capable of **real-time detection** of produce spoilage.
2. To enable accurate classification between **fresh** and **rotten** classes for various fruits.
3. To create a **lightweight**, deployable solution optimized for speed and size (under 6 MB).
4. To build a robust, diverse dataset with **custom annotations** for effective training and generalization.

## Sample Outputs

Example detections using SpoilSense:

| Input Image | Detection Output |
|-------------|------------------|
| ![input1](assets/example_outputs/input1.jpg) | ![output1](assets/example_outputs/output1.jpg) |
| ![input2](assets/example_outputs/input2.jpg) | ![output2](assets/example_outputs/output2.jpg) |

## How to Use

### 1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SpoilSense.git
cd SpoilSense
```

### 2. **Run Inference**
```bash
python scripts/inference.py --source path/to/image_or_folder --weights model/best.pt
```

### 3. **Optional GUI (Drag-and-Drop Demo)**
```bash
python scripts/gui_demo.py
```

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes 8 classes:
- Fresh and Rotten variants of: **Apple**, **Banana**, **Tomato**, **Orange**

All images were annotated manually using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) and exported in YOLO format, with custom class mappings and varying conditions to simulate real-world environments (e.g., lighting, angle, partial rot).

## Potential Future Improvements

- Retrain the model with a larger set of photoes for more accuracy (more unannotated photoes in validation)
- Potentially lower the confidence threshold for less background misses
- Add more fruit/vegetable categories  
- Integrate temperature/humidity sensors for multi-modal spoilage detection  
- Build a mobile app version
- Optimize the model for edge use (such as with an Arduino, Raspberry PI, Jetson nano, etc.)
